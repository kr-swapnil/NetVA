Description: Performs network vulnerability analysis and help to identify vulnerable or critical proteins (VPs) and protein pairs (VPPs) 
	for a given protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. Hence, network vulnerability analysis is an approach to identify VPs and 
	VPPs by assessing networks based on its topological properties. The VPs and VPPs are identified based on eleven different 
	topological properties calculated for networks as constructed by deleting all nodes/proteins using one node and two nodes 
	approaches, respectively, from the original network under investigation. Further, it helps to identify influential proteins in a 
	given network based on the escape velocity centrality (EVC) and extended EVC (EVC+). This package provides the capabilities to use 
	multiple cores on Linux/macOS to parallelize the process using parallel package. It also helps to identify hubs and bottlenecks 
	present in the network based on the well-known pareto-principle of 80:20 rule.
