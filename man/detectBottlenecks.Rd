\usage{
detectBottlenecks(net, p = 20)

detectBottlenecks(net, p = 20)
}
\arguments{
\item{net}{An igraph graph object.}

\item{p}{Value of percent of nodes/proteins to be considered for the determination of betweenness cutoff. By default value is 20\%. It is an optional parameter.}

\item{method}{Method to identify bottleneck nodes. Currently this function supports only the method of Eighty-twenty principle (ETP).}

\item{validate}{Logical, TRUE or FALSE, whether to validate identified bottlenecks by rewiring of a given percentage of edges.}

\item{perturb}{Percentage value to rewire edges.}

\item{iter}{Number of iterations to perform rewiring and construction of new rewired networks. The default value is round(100/perturb).}

\item{ng}{Number of new graphs/networks to be constructed. The default value is the value of iter.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector containing all possible bottlenecks with bottleneck proteins' names and corresponding betweenness values as identified in the given network.
